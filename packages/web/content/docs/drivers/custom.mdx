## Driver

Damian uses slonik under the hood, so you can create a custom driver by using any slonik-compatible driver factory.

In the example below, we are using [pglite](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite) with the slonik driver.

```ts
import { PGLite } from '@electric-sql/pglite'
import { createPGLiteDriverFactory } from 'slonik-pglite-driver'
import { createDb, createSQL as customCreateSQL} from 'damian/custom'
import { createSQL as pgCreateSQL } from 'damian/pg'

const pgLiteDriverFactory = createPGLiteDriverFactory({
    db: new PGLite()
})

export const db = createDb({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL as string,
    driverFactory: pgLiteDriverFactory
})

export const dbSql = customCreateSQL()
export const pgSql = pgCreateSQL()
```

You can choose which `sql` tag to use, the custom one will return a raw slonik tag object with no built-in helpers.
