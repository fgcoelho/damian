## SQL-First

Damian is the last Javascript database framework you will ever need, and that's because **it is not an orm** and **it is not a query builder**.

When you use Damian, you write SQL, always:

1. Write a migration file in SQL
2. Generate types using only migrations
3. Write a query in SQL with type-safe helpers
4. Get type-safe results

It is simple, built on battle-tested libraries such as [dbmate](dbmate) and [slonik](slonik), and it works.

## Supported databases

Only PostgreSQL is supported for now. But if slonik and dbmate support it, Damian will too.

## Can I trust this library?

Damian is actually just a thin wrapper around slonik, dbmate and WASM implementations of SQL databases. Most of what's working here is battle-tested code.
